# Model Context Protocol (MCP): Overview and Core Principles

**What is MCP?** The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that defines how AI applications (like large language model assistants) can be **extended with external context and tools** in a uniform way ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=What%20is%20MCP%3F)). You can think of MCP as a **“plugin system” for AI models** – much like a USB-C port for AI systems – enabling any client to connect with any tool provider via a standard interface ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=It%20provides%20the%20universal%20rules,Databases%2C%20Gmail%2C%20Slack%2C%20etc)). Instead of writing custom integrations for each data source or API, developers can rely on MCP’s standardized rules so that *LLM-based agents and external services can talk to each other seamlessly* ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20addresses%20this%20challenge,to%20the%20data%20they%20need)). 

**Core Architecture:** MCP follows a **client–server architecture** ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20MCP%20follows,can%20connect%20to%20multiple%20servers)). In this design: 

- **MCP Servers:** Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities (tools or data) through the MCP interface ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20MCP%20follows,can%20connect%20to%20multiple%20servers)). Each server might connect to local files, databases, APIs, or other resources. For example, one server could offer database query tools, another could manage code execution, etc. 
- **MCP Clients:** Components that manage the connection to an MCP server (often built into the host application). The client handles the protocol details and maintains a one-to-one link with the server.
- **Host Application:** The AI application or agent platform (e.g. Cursor IDE, Claude Desktop, etc.) that uses an MCP client to incorporate external tools ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=,the%20standardized%20Model%20Context%20Protocol)). The host orchestrates LLM interactions and decides when to invoke a tool via MCP.
- **Base Protocol:** A set of **universal rules for communication** between clients and servers (using JSON messages), ensuring interoperability regardless of who built the client or server ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=It%20provides%20the%20universal%20rules,Databases%2C%20Gmail%2C%20Slack%2C%20etc)) ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=MCP%20defines%20how%20clients%20should,More%20on%20this%20later)).

**How MCP Works:** At startup, an MCP server advertises the **tools and resources** it provides (including each tool’s name, description, and expected parameters) ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=MCP%20defines%20how%20clients%20should,More%20on%20this%20later)). The host (client) discovers these and can present them as available actions to the AI model. When the AI agent decides to use a tool, the host sends a **`call_tool` request** to the server with the tool name and arguments (in JSON format). The server executes the requested action and returns the result (or error) as a JSON response. This standardized request/response flow lets the AI agent use the tool’s output in its reasoning. *In essence, MCP bridges the gap between an AI model and external systems by defining a clear, JSON-based function call interface.* 

**MCP Tools vs. Resources:** MCP defines two kinds of capabilities a server can offer: **Tools** (actions or functions the LLM can invoke) and **Resources** (read-only contextual data the LLM can access) ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=MCP%20defines%20how%20clients%20should,More%20on%20this%20later)). For example, a “tool” might be *`query_database(sql)`* returning query results, whereas a “resource” might be a dataset or document the model can retrieve. **Currently, Cursor supports tools (function calls) via MCP; resource support is planned for the future** ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20Resources)). Each tool is like a function with a signature – it has a name, input parameters, and some output. The model can ask to use a tool, and the MCP client will invoke it through the server, then feed the result back to the model.

**Key Principles and Benefits:** MCP’s core principles center on **standardization, security, and flexibility** ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=MCP%20helps%20you%20build%20agents,and%20tools%2C%20and%20MCP%20provides)) ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Standardization)):

- *Standard Interface:* MCP provides a **unified integration protocol** – any MCP-compliant client can talk to any MCP-compliant server ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=It%20provides%20the%20universal%20rules,Databases%2C%20Gmail%2C%20Slack%2C%20etc)) ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=1,any%20LLM%20to%20any%20tool)). This decouples tool developers from agent developers. For example, Cursor can connect to *any* MCP server that follows the spec, whether it’s for GitHub, a database, or a custom tool, without bespoke adapters.
- *Reduced Development Effort:* By following common patterns (similar to how Language Server Protocol standardized IDE integrations), MCP **reduces the need to reinvent APIs** for each new tool ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=Benefits%20of%20Standardization)). Developers can leverage a growing list of pre-built MCP integrations (for Slack, Google Drive, databases, etc.) and focus on their unique logic ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=MCP%20helps%20you%20build%20agents,and%20tools%2C%20and%20MCP%20provides)).
- *Secure Data Access:* MCP is designed for **secure, two-way connections between AI and data sources** ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20is,that%20connect%20to%20these%20servers)). Data stays within your infrastructure via the MCP server – the LLM only sees what the tool returns. This allows organizations to expose internal data to AI agents safely, with auditing of tool usage. (For instance, an MCP server can enforce access controls or sanitize outputs before returning them.)
- *Separation of Concerns:* It cleanly separates the **LLM’s reasoning** from **external computations/data retrieval** ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=3,tools%29%20are%20cleanly%20separated)). The LLM doesn’t need direct database connectivity or internet access; it simply requests a tool, and the MCP server handles the rest. This makes systems more maintainable and modular.
- *Flexibility and Portability:* MCP is **language-agnostic and platform-agnostic**. An MCP server can be written in any language (anything that can output JSON to stdout or serve HTTP) ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20servers%20can%20be%20written,and%20technology%20stack%20very%20quickly)). It can run locally or remotely. This means you can write your server in Python, Node.js, etc., and as long as it follows the protocol, Cursor or any host can use it. Additionally, you can swap out the LLM or host application without changing the MCP server – *e.g.*, today you might use Cursor (with OpenAI’s GPT-4) as the host, and tomorrow an Anthropic Claude-based app – both can utilize the same MCP server tools ([Introduction - Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction#:~:text=MCP%20helps%20you%20build%20agents,and%20tools%2C%20and%20MCP%20provides)).
- *Interactivity and Approval:* When an AI agent (like Cursor’s) wants to use an MCP tool, the user typically gets a prompt to approve the action (to maintain control) ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Tool%20Approval)). You can even enable “**Yolo mode**” to auto-approve tool usage for faster workflows ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Yolo%20Mode)). This safety check is part of MCP’s integration into user-facing apps, ensuring tools don’t run without awareness.

**Transports – STDIO vs. SSE:** MCP supports multiple transport mechanisms for connecting the host and server ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=,locally)) ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=)):

- **STDIO (Standard I/O) Transport:** Easiest for local setups. Cursor (or the host app) will spawn the MCP server process on your machine and communicate via its stdin/stdout streams ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=stdio%20Transport)). This is managed automatically by the host – you just provide the command to run. STDIO servers are only accessible locally (no network exposure) ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=)). This mode is great for quick local tools and development, since you don’t need to set up a web service. In STDIO mode, the server prints JSON messages to stdout and reads JSON requests from stdin.
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events) Transport:** Suited for remote or persistent services. The MCP server runs as a service (e.g. a web server) that exposes an **`/sse` endpoint** for event streaming ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=,machines)). The host connects to this HTTP endpoint to send/receive JSON events. SSE servers can be shared across machines or a team, since they run over a network ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=,remotely)). You’d use SSE when you want a long-running central MCP service (for example, a cloud-hosted knowledge base accessible to multiple users). It requires a bit more setup (running a web server, handling HTTP connections), but offers more flexibility in deployment. 

In practice, both transports deliver the same JSON message types (tool listings, tool invocation requests, responses), just over different channels. **STDIO is simpler to get started (no need for networking code), whereas SSE is ideal if you want to host the MCP server independently or have multiple clients use it** ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Each%20transport%20type%20has%20different,more%20flexibility%20for%20distributed%20teams)). Many developers prototype with STDIO and later move to SSE for sharing or scaling the tool.

**MCP in Action (Example):** Imagine you have a database and you want your AI coding assistant to query it. Instead of feeding the schema and data to the model, you write an MCP server (perhaps in Python) that offers a tool `query_db(sql: str) -> str`. When the agent needs data, it will call `query_db` via MCP. The server receives a JSON like: 

```json
{ "method": "call_tool", "params": { "name": "query_db", "arguments": { "sql": "<...>" } } }
``` 

 ([Crew AI MCP Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/y5nsuuf5t8#:~:text=%7B%20,%7D%20%7D)), executes the SQL on the database, then returns the results in a JSON response. Cursor would display the result to you and incorporate it into the AI’s context for follow-up questions. From the AI’s perspective, it simply used a function – all the heavy lifting (connecting to DB, executing query) was done by the MCP server. 

**MCP Adoption:** Since its introduction by Anthropic in late 2024, MCP has quickly gained traction ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%27re%20open,produce%20better%2C%20more%20relevant%20responses)) ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20is,that%20connect%20to%20these%20servers)). IDEs like Cursor, Claude Desktop, and others have added MCP support ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=,source%20repository%20of%20MCP%20servers)), and open-source MCP servers exist for many common tools (Git, GitHub, Slack, databases, browsers, etc.) ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Claude%203,GitHub%2C%20Git%2C%20Postgres%2C%20and%20Puppeteer)). The protocol is still evolving (with improvements to things like streaming and state handling in discussion), but it’s already a powerful way to extend AI assistants with custom capabilities. Next, we’ll walk through how to create your own MCP server in Python – specifically, one that integrates a **CrewAI-based coding agent** as a tool for Cursor to use.

# Setting Up a Custom MCP Server in Python (CrewAI Coding Agent Integration)

In this section, we’ll create a step-by-step guide to build and configure a custom MCP server in Python. Our goal is to integrate a **CrewAI-based coding agent** as an MCP tool that Cursor (or any MCP-enabled AI agent) can utilize. By the end, you will have a Python MCP server that registers the CrewAI agent as a tool, and you’ll know how to connect it with Cursor for real-time use.

## 1. Setup Requirements

Before coding, ensure you have the following in place:

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system ([Crew AI MCP Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/y5nsuuf5t8#:~:text=System%20Requirements)). (CrewAI and MCP libraries require a modern Python version.)
- **CrewAI library** and its tools installed. CrewAI is an open-source Python framework for orchestrating AI agents. You can install it via pip:
  ```bash
  pip install crewai crewai_tools
  ``` 
  The `crewai_tools` package is needed if you want the agent to actually execute code ([Coding Agents - CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/coding-agents#:~:text=3,%E2%80%9D)).
- **MCP Python SDK or framework**. There is an official MCP Python SDK that simplifies server creation (providing decorators and classes to define tools). Install it with:
  ```bash
  pip install modelcontext
  ``` 
  *(If this package name doesn’t work, check MCP documentation for the latest Python SDK name. Alternatively, you can implement the STDIO protocol manually using Python’s `sys.stdin`/`stdout` – but using the SDK is recommended for correctness.)*
- **OpenAI API Key (or other LLM API key)**: CrewAI agents typically rely on an LLM backend (like OpenAI’s GPT-4) to function. For our setup, we’ll assume use of OpenAI’s API. Obtain an API key and set it as an environment variable:
  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
  ``` 
  This ensures the CrewAI agent can call the model. (CrewAI will pick this up to use the OpenAI API for the agent’s intelligence ([Crew AI MCP Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/y5nsuuf5t8#:~:text=,set%20their%20OpenAI%20API%20key)) ([Crew AI MCP Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/y5nsuuf5t8#:~:text=Before%20using%20the%20server%2C%20set,your%20OpenAI%20API%20key)).)
- **Cursor IDE installed** (or another MCP client host). We’ll focus on Cursor integration. Make sure you have Cursor running and updated to a version that supports MCP. 

Optionally:
- **jq (for JSON formatting)** or other dev tools if you plan to run/test your server from the command line as shown in some examples ([Crew AI MCP Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/y5nsuuf5t8#:~:text=%28echo%20%27%7B,true%7D%7D%7D%27%29%20%7C%20python3%20src%2Fcrew_server.py)). Not strictly required, but can help in debugging.
- **Docker** if you intend to use CrewAI’s *safe code execution mode* (which runs code in a Docker sandbox) ([Agents - CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#:~:text=Respect%20Context%20Window%20%28optional%29,sources%20available%20to%20the%20agent)). If Docker is not available, you can configure the agent to use “unsafe” mode (executing code directly in the local environment) or simply trust it for local testing.

## 2. Key Configuration and Installation Steps

Now that requirements are set, let’s get everything installed and configured:

**a. Create a Project Directory:** Set up a dedicated directory for your MCP server project (e.g., `my_mcp_server/`). This helps keep your code organized, and you can place a Cursor config here later if using project-specific settings.

**b. Initialize a Virtual Environment (optional):** It’s a good practice to use a Python virtual environment for isolating dependencies:
```bash
cd my_mcp_server
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

**c. Install Dependencies:** As mentioned, install the necessary Python packages in this environment:
```bash
pip install crewai crewai_tools modelcontext
``` 
This pulls in CrewAI and the MCP SDK. The MCP SDK (`modelcontext`) will provide classes to define an MCP server and handle communication, while CrewAI provides the agent framework.

**d. Verify Installation:** You can do a quick check by importing the libraries in Python:
```python
import crewai
from mcp.server import fastmcp
``` 
If no import errors occur, you’re set. Also, ensure your OpenAI API key is in the environment (test with `echo $OPENAI_API_KEY` in your shell).

**e. Configuration for CrewAI (API Keys etc.):** CrewAI will use the `OPENAI_API_KEY` by default. No further config is needed if that env var is set ([Crew AI MCP Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/y5nsuuf5t8#:~:text=Before%20using%20the%20server%2C%20set,your%20OpenAI%20API%20key)). If you want to use a different model provider (like Anthropic’s Claude), you’d set the corresponding key and possibly specify the model in the agent creation. For our guide, we’ll stick with OpenAI.

At this point, the environment is ready. Next, we’ll write the MCP server code that creates a CrewAI coding agent tool.

## 3. Writing the MCP Server Script (Integrating CrewAI Agent)

We will implement a Python script (let’s call it `crew_mcp_server.py`) that defines the MCP server and the CrewAI tool. There are two ways to implement the server logic:

- **Using the MCP SDK (High-level approach):** This provides decorators and classes to define tools easily and handles all JSON I/O for you.
- **Manual JSON handling (Low-level approach):** You read from `stdin`, parse JSON, and write responses to `stdout`. This is more involved and error-prone, so we’ll use the SDK for brevity and reliability.

**Using the MCP Python SDK with FastMCP:** The SDK’s `FastMCP` class simplifies creating a server that can run in STDIO or SSE mode. We’ll use it to define our tool.

Open `crew_mcp_server.py` in an editor and write the following code (comments explain each part):

```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP, Context
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew

# Initialize the MCP server with a descriptive name
mcp = FastMCP("CrewAI Code Agent")  # This name will identify the server in Cursor

# Define a tool using a decorator. This will register the tool with MCP.
@mcp.tool()
def solve_coding_task(description: str) -> str:
    """
    Use a CrewAI coding agent to solve a programming task described by 'description'.
    Returns the code or result produced by the agent.
    """
    # 1. Create a CrewAI agent with code execution enabled
    agent = Agent(
        role="Senior Python Developer",
        goal="Write correct and efficient code for the given task",
        backstory="An autonomous coding assistant with expertise in Python.",
        allow_code_execution=True  # enable running code
    )
    # 2. Define a task for the agent to accomplish
    task = Task(
        description=description,
        expected_output="Python code solution"  # hint for what we expect
    )
    # 3. Create a crew (group) with the single agent and task, then run it
    crew = Crew(agents=[agent], tasks=[task], verbose=False)
    crew.run()  # or crew.kickoff(), depending on CrewAI version
    # 4. Retrieve the result. We assume the agent's final answer is stored in task.result.
    solution = task.result  if hasattr(task, "result") else "(No result)"
    return solution

# If running as main program, start the MCP server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This will start listening for STDIO requests (or start an SSE server if configured for SSE)
    mcp.serve()
```

Let’s break down what this code does:

- We create an `FastMCP` server instance named `"CrewAI Code Agent"`. This name may appear in Cursor’s UI under MCP servers, and also helps identify the tool context to the AI.
- Using `@mcp.tool()` decorator, we define a function `solve_coding_task` that takes a description (string) and returns a string result. The docstring of this function (“Use a CrewAI coding agent…”) becomes the **tool’s description** that Cursor will see. The parameter name and type (`description: str`) becomes the tool’s expected argument.
- Inside the tool function:
  1. We instantiate a CrewAI `Agent` with a specified role and goal. We set `allow_code_execution=True` so this agent can write and run code as part of its reasoning ([Coding Agents - CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/coding-agents#:~:text=coding_agent%20%3D%20Agent%28%20role%3D,allow_code_execution%3DTrue)). (Under the hood, CrewAI will provide the agent with tools to execute code in Python.)
  2. We create a `Task` for the agent, providing the `description` (what we want it to do) and an expected output hint. The description could be something like “Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a given key.” This Task essentially encapsulates the user request for the agent.
  3. We create a `Crew` with our single agent and single task. A “crew” in CrewAI can manage multiple agents and tasks working together, but here it’s just one agent solving one task. We then call `crew.run()` to let the agent start working on the task autonomously. (Depending on the CrewAI version, the method might be `run()` or `kickoff(inputs)` – consult CrewAI docs for the exact call. The idea is to run the agent until it finishes or hits its limits.)
  4. After execution, we extract the result. CrewAI’s agent will generate a solution for the task. In many cases, CrewAI might store the final answer in `task.result` or similar property. We retrieve it and return it as the output of our tool. The MCP SDK will take this return value and package it into the appropriate JSON response to the host.

- Finally, `mcp.serve()` starts the server. In STDIO mode, this means waiting for JSON requests on stdin (such as a `{"method": "call_tool", ...}`) and responding on stdout. The SDK handles the loop and ensures our `solve_coding_task` function is called when the agent triggers that tool.

**Note:** The above code uses CrewAI’s high-level API. The *specifics* of creating/running a CrewAI agent may vary. For example, some versions might require `crew.run(sync=True)` or retrieving output via `agent.get_output()` if provided. Adjust the code according to the CrewAI version you have. The structure, however, remains: create agent -> assign task -> run -> get result.

After writing this script, save it. This is our MCP server program. Next, we need to let Cursor know about it and test the integration.

## 4. Registering the MCP Server in Cursor (Making Cursor Use the Tool)

For Cursor to utilize our new MCP server and its tool, we must register the server in Cursor’s settings. There are two ways to do this:

**Option A: Project-specific config file (.cursor/mcp.json)** – If you only want this tool available for a particular project folder.

**Option B: Global config (~/\.cursor/mcp.json)** – If you want the tool available in all Cursor projects.

We’ll illustrate Option A for clarity, but the format is identical for both (just the file location differs).

### Using a Configuration File

1. **Create the config file:** In your project directory (the one opened in Cursor), create a folder called `.cursor` (if it doesn’t exist). Inside it, create a file named `mcp.json`.

2. **Add MCP server config:** In `mcp.json`, define an entry for your server. For STDIO transport, you specify the command to run. For example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "crewai-code-agent": {  
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["crew_mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here, **`crewai-code-agent`** is a nickname for the server (you can choose any identifier). We tell Cursor to run `python3 crew_mcp_server.py` as the command. The `env` section passes the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from your environment to the process – this ensures the subprocess has access to the API key (you could also hardcode the key here, but it’s safer to reference an environment variable) ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=%22mcpServers%22%3A%20%7B%20%22server,%7D%20%7D)) ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=The%20,keys%20and%20other%20sensitive%20configuration)). 

Make sure the path to `crew_mcp_server.py` is correct. If Cursor’s working directory is the project root, having the script in the root and referencing it by name is fine. Otherwise, provide a full path.

3. **Restart Cursor** (or reload the MCP config): When Cursor launches, it will read this config, spawn the MCP server, and register its tools. You should see in Cursor’s UI (usually under *Settings > MCP Servers* or in the chat sidebar under “Available Tools”) that a new tool has been added. The tool will likely be listed by the name `solve_coding_task` with the description from our function docstring. *If you use Cursor’s UI to add the server instead*, you would select “Add new MCP server”, choose type “stdio”, enter the command and args similarly ([MCP Server - Mem0](https://docs.mem0.ai/integrations/mcp-server#:~:text=3,Restart%20Cursor%20to%20apply%20changes)).

### Using SSE (if needed)

If you prefer an SSE server (say you want to run `crew_mcp_server.py` continuously on a server machine), you’d run it as a web service. The MCP SDK can host an SSE endpoint if you call `mcp.serve("0.0.0.0", 8000)` or similar (or using an ASGI server). For brevity, we used STDIO. With SSE, in Cursor’s MCP settings you would provide the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/sse`) instead of a command ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=,machines)). The rest of the integration remains similar, but you’d manage starting the server yourself.

After registering and restarting Cursor, the CrewAI tool is now integrated. Let’s outline how to use it and what to expect.

## 5. Handling Requests and Responses (MCP Communication Flow)

With the server running and Cursor aware of it, here’s how interactions happen under the hood when you or the AI triggers the tool:

- **Tool Discovery:** Upon connecting, Cursor’s MCP client will query the server for its capabilities. The MCP SDK handles this by advertising the `solve_coding_task` tool (including its parameter schema and description) to Cursor automatically. You should see this tool listed in Cursor’s “Available Tools” for the agent ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Using%20MCP%20Tools%20in%20Agent)).

- **Agent Invocation:** You can now instruct the AI in Cursor to use the tool. For example, in Cursor’s chat you might say: *“Use the CrewAI Code Agent to write a function that calculates Fibonacci numbers.”* The agent (backed by an LLM like GPT-4) will decide to call our tool. Alternatively, the agent might autonomously choose to call it if it knows the tool could help with a coding request. 

- **Call Format:** Cursor will send a JSON request to our MCP server via STDIO. It follows the MCP protocol format, which is similar to JSON-RPC. For example, the request might look like: 
  ```json
  {
    "id": "<some unique id>",
    "method": "call_tool",
    "params": {
      "name": "solve_coding_task",
      "arguments": {
        "description": "Write a Python function to generate Fibonacci numbers up to N."
      }
    }
  }
  ``` 
   ([Crew AI MCP Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/y5nsuuf5t8#:~:text=%7B%20,%7D%20%7D)). Here, `name` matches the tool function name, and `arguments` contains the JSON-serialized function arguments (in our case, just the description string). The `id` is used by the protocol to match responses to requests.

- **Server Processing:** The MCP SDK on our side receives this request and maps it to the `solve_coding_task` Python function. It parses the `"description"` argument and calls our function. Inside our function, the CrewAI agent kicks off: it will prompt the underlying LLM (via OpenAI API) with the role/backstory and task we provided. The agent may go through several iterations, possibly executing code, until it arrives at a final solution. (This might take a few seconds depending on complexity and model speed.)

- **Tool Response:** Once our function returns (with the `solution` string), the MCP server sends back a response JSON to Cursor. The exact format might be:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "<same id as request>",
    "result": "<solution string>"
  }
  ``` 
  The MCP client (Cursor) receives this and passes the result to the AI agent or displays it. In Cursor’s chat, you’ll see the tool’s response appear, usually tagged with the tool name. For example, it might show something like:
  ```
  [CrewAI Code Agent] 
  def fibonacci(n):
      a, b = 0, 1
      result = []
      for _ in range(n):
          result.append(a)
          a, b = b, a+b
      return result
  ```
  (assuming that’s the code the agent came up with). This output is now part of the conversation – the AI can continue using it or refining it.

- **Approval Workflow:** By default, Cursor will ask you to approve running the tool the first time (and possibly every time, unless Yolo mode is on) ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Tool%20Approval)). You’ll see a prompt like “Agent requests to use tool *solve_coding_task* with arguments: {description: '...'}”. You can approve to let it proceed. This is a safeguard so the AI doesn’t run tools without user consent. If you trust the tool and want to streamline, you could enable *Yolo mode* to auto-approve tool calls ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Yolo%20Mode)).

- **Iterative Use:** The AI might call the tool again if needed (for instance, it might get an error from code execution and try again). Our server will handle each call in isolation (since our implementation isn’t maintaining state between calls, aside from what CrewAI does internally). If the task is complex, the CrewAI agent itself might have sub-steps internally, but from Cursor’s perspective, each `call_tool` yields a result.

**Handling Errors and Edge Cases:** If an error occurs in our tool function (say CrewAI raises an exception or the agent fails), the MCP server should catch it and return an error message. The MCP SDK likely does this automatically by returning an error payload. For best results, you might want to catch exceptions in `solve_coding_task` and return a safe message, e.g., return `"Error: " + str(e)` so that the AI gets a string response rather than a protocol-level error. This way, the AI can decide how to handle it (maybe apologize or try a different approach).

**Logging:** Remember that anything your server prints to stdout (besides the JSON protocol responses) could confuse the MCP client. **Avoid printing extraneous text** in the server script. If you need to log, print to stderr or to a file. The MCP JSON messages should be the only thing on stdout. The MCP SDK’s `FastMCP` takes care of formatting output, so if using it, just refrain from stray `print()` calls in your tool function.

## 6. Testing the Integration

With everything set up, test the end-to-end flow:

- **Start Cursor and open the project** where your `mcp.json` is configured. Cursor should automatically launch the `crew_mcp_server.py` process. (You might see your Python script running in the background. If it crashes, check the Cursor console or logs for errors.)
- In Cursor’s chat, try prompting the agent in a way that invokes the tool. For example: *“Please use the CrewAI Code Agent tool to create a Python function that checks if a number is prime.”* The agent should recognize the tool from the prompt (the tool’s description and name are visible to it) and issue a `call_tool` request.
- Approve the tool usage when prompted. Then wait for the result. You should see the output appear as described. Verify that the output makes sense (it should be the code or solution the CrewAI agent generated).
- You can also manually verify the tool via Cursor’s UI: Cursor often lists available tools in a side panel. You might trigger it directly by typing something like `@tool solve_coding_task("your description")` if Cursor’s interface allows calling tools by name. Refer to Cursor documentation on manually invoking a tool – but generally, instructing the AI in natural language is sufficient.

If the tool doesn’t appear or isn’t used, see the next section for troubleshooting.

## 7. Best Practices for Seamless Integration

To ensure your custom MCP server works smoothly with Cursor (or any host), consider these best practices:

- **Keep Tool Descriptions Clear:** The docstring of the tool function serves as the description shown to the AI. Make it **concise and explicit** about what the tool does ([What is Model Context Protocol (MCP): Explained in detail - DEV Community](https://dev.to/composiodev/what-is-model-context-protocol-mcp-explained-in-detail-5f53#:~:text=MCP%20defines%20how%20clients%20should,More%20on%20this%20later)). For instance, “**Tool**: Uses a Python AI agent to generate code for a given task description.” A good description helps the LLM decide when to use the tool.
- **Limit Tool Scope:** Each MCP tool should ideally do one thing well (like the single function generation in our case). Avoid making a “god tool” that does too many disparate actions based on parameters. Simpler tools are easier for the AI to understand and for you to maintain.
- **Test in Isolation:** Before relying on Cursor, test your MCP server standalone. You can do this by simulating input to your script. For example, run:
  ```bash
  echo '{"method":"call_tool","params":{"name":"solve_coding_task","arguments":{"description":"Hello World printing"}}}' | python3 crew_mcp_server.py
  ``` 
  This pipes a sample request to your server. You should get a JSON response (likely on stdout). This kind of testing can reveal JSON parsing issues or exceptions early.
- **Use Environment Variables for Secrets:** We passed the OpenAI key via `env` in config – continue this practice for any other credentials (e.g., if CrewAI needed a HuggingFace token, etc.) ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=The%20,keys%20and%20other%20sensitive%20configuration)). This keeps your code and config safe (no hard-coded secrets).
- **Resource Management:** The CrewAI agent might execute code – ensure that the environment it runs in is controlled. By default, CrewAI’s safe mode runs code in Docker ([Agents - CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#:~:text=Respect%20Context%20Window%20%28optional%29,sources%20available%20to%20the%20agent)); if using unsafe mode, be aware that the code runs on your machine with your Python process’s privileges. Only enable this for trusted tasks or in a sandbox environment.
- **Timeouts and Long-Running Tasks:** An MCP tool call shouldn’t run indefinitely. CrewAI agents have a `max_iter` (max iterations) and `max_execution_time` parameters ([Agents - CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#:~:text=model%20for%20tool%20calling%2C%20overrides,Default%20is%20True)) ([Agents - CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#:~:text=rate%20limits,Default%20is%20False)). Consider setting those to reasonable values when creating the agent (CrewAI defaults are often fine, e.g., 20 iterations or a couple of minutes). This prevents the tool from hanging. Cursor may also impose a timeout on tool responses – check Cursor’s documentation if you encounter cuts in output.
- **User Prompts vs. Autonomous Use:** Sometimes the AI might not automatically realize it should use the tool. Don’t hesitate to **prompt the use of the tool explicitly** in conversation (e.g., “Use the CrewAI tool to do X.”). This helps during testing to ensure the pipeline works, and it allows you to compare the agent’s own solution vs. the tool’s result. 
- **Tool Name vs. Description:** The agent can refer to the tool by name or description in natural language. Our tool name `solve_coding_task` is a bit technical; Cursor’s agent might refer to it as “the CrewAI Code Agent tool” (coming from server name or description). Ensure the naming in the description is human-friendly. We named the server "CrewAI Code Agent" – Cursor might prepend that to tool outputs or use it in disambiguation.
- **Security and Confirmation:** If your tool can make changes (e.g., write to files or execute arbitrary code), keep the confirmation step (`Yolo mode` off) until you trust it fully ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=)). It’s a good practice to supervise the first few runs and see that the agent behaves as expected.

## 8. Common Challenges and Troubleshooting

Even with careful setup, you might hit some bumps. Here are common issues and how to address them:

- **Tool not showing up in Cursor:** If you don’t see the tool listed in Cursor’s MCP panel, or the agent says it has no knowledge of it:
  - Double-check your `mcp.json` config syntax. A missing comma or brace can cause Cursor to ignore the file. 
  - Ensure the config file is in the correct location. For project-specific, it must be at `project/.cursor/mcp.json`. For global, `~/.cursor/mcp.json` ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=Project%20Configuration)). Also, verify Cursor actually loaded it (you might need to restart the application).
  - Confirm that the path/command is correct. If using STDIO, try running the command yourself in a terminal. If it fails (e.g., wrong path to script or missing module import), Cursor may have started it and it exited immediately. Fix any such errors and restart Cursor.
  - If using SSE, ensure the URL is reachable and the server is running. You can try `curl http://localhost:8000/sse` to see if you get an SSE response.
  
- **Server crashes or exits unexpectedly:** Run the server script in a standalone mode to see any traceback. Common issues include missing environment variables (e.g., forgot to set OPENAI_API_KEY) or missing dependencies (maybe crewai_tools wasn’t installed, causing an import error when `allow_code_execution=True`) ([Crew AI MCP Server | Glama](https://glama.ai/mcp/servers/y5nsuuf5t8#:~:text=If%20you%20encounter%20any%20issues%3A)). Install any missing packages and make sure to handle exceptions in the tool function so a runtime error doesn’t kill the server.

- **CrewAI agent errors:** If the CrewAI agent fails, you may get an error string as output or nothing at all. Check the console where the MCP server is running. CrewAI might log info or errors there (especially if `verbose=True`). Some things to consider:
  - Did you install `crewai_tools`? If not, the agent might warn that code execution tools are unavailable ([Coding Agents - CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/coding-agents#:~:text=3,%E2%80%9D)). Install it or set `allow_code_execution=False` (though that defeats our purpose here).
  - Is Docker running (for safe mode)? If not, you might see an error when the agent tries to execute code. As a quick fix, you can configure the agent with `code_execution_mode="unsafe"` to run code directly ([Agents - CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/agents#:~:text=Respect%20Context%20Window%20%28optional%29,sources%20available%20to%20the%20agent)), or start your Docker service.
  - Does the agent have internet access or require any other API keys for tools? (In our scenario, we didn’t include extra tools for the agent besides code execution. If you gave it web search tools, you’d need those configured too.)
  - If the agent’s LLM calls are hitting rate limits or are unauthorized, check that the OpenAI key is correct and that you haven’t exhausted your quota.

- **No output or wrong output from tool:** If `task.result` is coming back empty or the agent didn’t actually produce code, you might need to adjust how you retrieve the agent’s output. Ensure that after `crew.run()`, the `task` object has the result. If not, consult CrewAI docs – possibly the result could be in `agent.result` or the agent might return the answer differently. As a debugging step, you can have the tool function return something like all conversation logs or interim code to see what happened.
  
- **Agent not using the tool when it should:** This could be because the AI model doesn’t realize the tool’s usefulness or is hallucinating its own solution. To guide it, refine the tool description or explicitly instruct usage. If the issue persists, it might be that the agent (GPT-4, etc.) thinks it can handle the request without the tool. You can enforce usage by phrasing the query like “Using the provided tool, do X”.

- **Performance considerations:** The overhead of calling an MCP tool includes inter-process communication and the CrewAI agent’s own latency. For simpler tasks, the AI might solve it faster by itself. That’s okay – MCP tools are most beneficial for tasks the model can’t do alone (like accessing private data or performing long computations). If you find the tool is slow:
  - Make sure you’re not running in debug mode (CrewAI’s `verbose` was set to False in our code to reduce overhead).
  - The network calls to OpenAI could be the bottleneck; upgrading to a faster model (if using GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5) or adjusting the task complexity might help.
  - Subsequent uses might be faster if the agent reuses some context (CrewAI might keep some state if the same process handles multiple calls, though our simple approach recreates the agent each time).

- **MCP server state between calls:** In our design, each tool call creates a fresh agent and task. If you wanted to maintain a persistent agent across calls (for example, an agent that incrementally builds a project), you’d have to store it as global state in the server. That’s more advanced – you’d need the server to recognize when the same agent is being addressed and avoid reinitializing. The MCP protocol supports “resources” which could store state, but Cursor doesn’t utilize that yet ([Cursor – Model Context Protocol](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#:~:text=MCP%20Resources)). So for now, the simpler stateless approach per call is fine. Just be aware that each call is independent.

If all is set up correctly, your custom MCP server should function as a new powerful tool in Cursor. You’ve effectively *plugged in* a CrewAI autonomous coding agent into your development environment. This means the next time you’re working on code and need a complex function written or analyzed, Cursor’s AI can delegate that work to your CrewAI agent tool automatically.
